  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: Oh, no. Sorry dear, not this time. You see, I had quite the adventure
      yesterday, and was hoping to have a nice chat with some nice folks such as
      yourself to tell you about it.
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "Ah, sorry Mrs. Perkins. I\u2019m not really feeling it tonight. I
      had to throw out a perfectly good pizza earlier and it\u2019s kind of eating
      me up. I think I\u2019m gonna turn in early tonight."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Oh, I\u2019m sorry dear. That doesn\u2019t sound pleasant. Well, I
      won\u2019t keep you then. I guess this old lady should turn in early as well.
      You get some rest."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: You too, Mrs. Perkins. Have a good night.
