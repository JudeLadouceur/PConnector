    dialogue: Hello dear, this is Mrs. Perkins. You see, after the shenanigans I
      had with my blasted computer yesterday, I was left quite frustrated. I was
      hoping to call someone and have a nice chat to help get my mind off of things.
      Would you mind connecting me to someone who can help?
