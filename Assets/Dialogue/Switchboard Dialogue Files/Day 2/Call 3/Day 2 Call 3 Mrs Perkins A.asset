    dialogue: "Well, you see, a big group cancelled right when I made their order,
      and I have some pizza just hanging around. I want to sell it while it\u2019s
      fresh, but I don\u2019t know who would want a pizza like this."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: Well, I may not be able to eat that whole darned thing myself, but
      I would be more than happy to buy that and share it with anyone at the park!
      Would that be okay, dearie?

      You should just make sure to chat with some folks in the park while you\u2019re
      there. You know, having some close friends can really help you when you\u2019re
      stuck in a situation like this."
