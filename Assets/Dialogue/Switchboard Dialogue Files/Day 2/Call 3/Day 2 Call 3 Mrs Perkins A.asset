    dialogue: "Well, you see, a big group cancelled on me and I wasn\u2019t paying
      attention to their booking, and I have some pizza just hanging around. I want
      to sell it while it\u2019s fresh, but I don\u2019t know who would want a pizza
      like this."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: 'Well, I may not be able to eat that whole darned thing myself, but
      would you be willing to set up a stand at the park, give it away to the children? '
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "That would be perfect, Mrs. Perkins! Thank you so much. Make sure
      you stop by too, I feel like you\u2019re barely around these days."

    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh, that sounds lovely dear. I\u2019ll even give you a good tip! It
      will be good to chat with folks again, it\u2019s been so quiet since Howard,
      well\u2026 Make sure you stay a while too. You know, having some close friends
      can really help you when you\u2019re stuck in a situation like this. "
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "That\u2019s a good point Mrs. Perkins. You know what, I think I will
      take the time to chat to some folks, I can get some feedback on my new pizza
      ideas! Thanks for the advice! That means a lot. "
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "No worries, dear. I\u2019ll meet you at the park soon. "
