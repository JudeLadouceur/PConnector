    dialogue: "Hey! This is Lin. I had planned to have a chat with Mrs. Perkins,
      and was looking through some old files in the town hall of things she\u2019s
      done, and I think I found an old voice recording of a message her husband had
      for her. I was hoping you could connect me to her so I could play it over the
      phone? I think she\u2019d really appreciate it."
