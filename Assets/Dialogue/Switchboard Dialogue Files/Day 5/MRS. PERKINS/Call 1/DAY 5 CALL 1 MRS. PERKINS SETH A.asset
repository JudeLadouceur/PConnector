    dialogue: "Seth\u2019s Repair Garage! What needs fixing today?"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Seth? Oh, dear, I\u2019m sorry. It seems I\u2019ve been connected
      to the wrong line."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Mrs. Perkins? That you? I gotta say, you don\u2019t sound too good.
      Everything alright?"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "I suppose this is a bit bittersweet for me, dear. You see, I\u2019ve
      made plans to move out of town. I can\u2019t connect with the people here anymore,
      and am looking to start anew."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "What? Moving out? Why on earth would you think you can\u2019t connect
      with the people of this town anymore?"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "I\u2019m just getting old, dear. I can\u2019t do things like I used
      to. I just can\u2019t keep up with how fast everything moves like I used to.
      I fear I\u2019m being left behind, I just can\u2019t help this town anymore."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Can\u2019t help the town anymore? Mrs. Perkins, what are you talking
      about? You still help people out all the time here."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: I appreciate you trying, dear. But it was you who fixed my walker,
      not the other way around.
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: Need I remind you who was the one who got me those parts when I needed
      them?
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Well\u2026 those were Howard\u2019s parts."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "And you chose to help me out. Not just that, you\u2019ve given me
      some small pep talks here and there. I\u2019ve often worried that I\u2019m
      not good enough in this town, that anything I do just isn\u2019t enough."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh, but you are dear. That\u2019s what I keep telling you"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019ve been
      able to stay on my feet thanks to you! Not just once, either. I would have
      closed shop long ago if not for your support, Mrs. P."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "I\u2026 I suppose I never thought of it that way."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Things might feel like they\u2019re moving fast, Mrs. Perkins. But
      I assure you, you haven\u2019t slowed down at all. You\u2019ve kept this town
      in good shape for years. So many of us owe you more than you know."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Perhaps\u2026 I was too rash to decide to move out like that. I think
      I\u2019ll reconsider."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "That\u2019s what I like to hear Mrs. Perkins."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "I suppose you\u2019re the one who got to give me a pep talk this time."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "We all need one sometimes. Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m just
      glad you\u2019re here."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Thanks a lot, dear. Maybe I\u2019ll stop by later and say hi."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: Sounds like a plan, Mrs. P. See you around.
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: You have a good day, dear.
