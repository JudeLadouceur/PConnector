  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "Lin\u2019s Pizza! What kind of fresh do you want today?"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Oh, hello Lin. This is Mrs. Perkins. I\u2019m sorry, but it seems
      I\u2019ve been connected to the wrong line."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "Oh? You don\u2019t sound great, Mrs. Perkins. Are you alright? Maybe
      a pizza will help."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "I suppose this is a bit bittersweet for me, dear. You see, I\u2019ve
      made plans to move out of town. I can\u2019t connect with the people here anymore,
      and am looking to start anew."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "What\u2026? Can\u2019t connect to the people here anymore? Mrs. Perkins,
      you\u2019re my most loyal customer! My pizza shop wouldn\u2019t have even gotten
      off the ground if not for you!"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Lin, dear, I think you might be exaggerating a bit. I know I buy your
      delicious pizza frequently, but I\u2019m not your only source of business.
      I don\u2019t make that kind of a difference in this town."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "It\u2019s not just that, Mrs. P! You\u2019re forgetting all the great
      things you\u2019ve done for this town! After my father walked away from the
      shop, I wasn\u2019t quite ready for the responsibility, I was so unorganized.
      It was only because you stayed with me three days in a row that I managed to
      get things in working order. I never would have even opened shop if not for
      you!"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Oh my\u2026. Did I really do that?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "You sure did, Mrs. Perkins. I\u2019m thinking you might have lost
      sight of all the wonderful contributions you\u2019ve made to this town over
      the years. You\u2019ve done so much, none of us could ever forget about you."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Well, I suppose I have been in this town for some time now\u2026 but
      it\u2019s Howard who made all the most meaningful contributions."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "And how far would Howard have gotten without you? Howard may have
      done a lot of technical stuff, but you\u2019ve always been the one to make
      people happy and bring the community together Mrs. Perkins. You matter here."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: You really think so, dear?
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: I know so, Mrs. Perkins.
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Well\u2026 maybe I was too rash to try to move out so soon. I think
      I\u2019ll reconsider my options. Thanks a lot for this Lin, I\u2019m glad I
      got to talk to you."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: Of course Mrs. P! If you ever want to talk more, I can have a pizza
      cooked and ready in minutes, and we can have a chat at the park or something.
      Just give me a call!
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: I will, dear. Thanks again.
