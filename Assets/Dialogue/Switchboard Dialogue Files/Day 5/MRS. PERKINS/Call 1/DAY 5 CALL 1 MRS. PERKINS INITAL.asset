    dialogue: "Oh hello, dear. This is Mrs. Perkins. You see, these past few days
      have been a lot on me. I feel I\u2019ve really been losing my connection to
      this town in my age."

    dialogue: "Oh, it gets so hard to keep up when the world moves too fast\u2026
      I hate to say it dear, but I think I need to move on. I\u2019ve lost touch
      with this town, and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m moving. It won\u2019t be that
      big of a deal. Nobody pays much attention to this old woman anyways. I was
      just calling to cancel my upcoming appointments so I can start making the arrangements.
      Could you do this old lady that one last favor and connect me to the emergency
      line?"
