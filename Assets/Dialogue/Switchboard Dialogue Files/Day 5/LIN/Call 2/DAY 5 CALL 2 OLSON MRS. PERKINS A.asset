  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: Hello! This is Mrs. Perkins.
  - speakerName: OLSON
    dialogue: Hmph. I see how it is. Fine. Let him live with his own failure and
      get nothing out of it.
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Oh, I know that voice. Don\u2019t you hang up on me, Olson! You listen
      here. You have no right to be talking to anyone in this town after you walked
      out on your son like that!"
  - speakerName: OLSON
    dialogue: "Well would you look at that, it seems the old hag finally grew a backbone.
      You never understood business, anyways. It was always about chats and tea time,
      wasn\u2019t it?"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Lecture me all you want. But heartless \u2018businessmen\u2019 like
      yourself will never understand the love people like your son put into their
      work. You hear me?! You don\u2019t deserve him as your son!"
  - speakerName: OLSON
    dialogue: "Oh, please. \u2018Love\u2019 is hardly a part of it. Besides, from
      what I\u2019ve heard, it seems his business is already failing. I suppose he
      finally realized he was in over his head"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Actually, it turns out he\u2019s doing quite well. We had a chat earlier
      and he\u2019s already figuring out how to keep his business going while taking
      care of himself. There hasn\u2019t been even a sound of complaint about his
      store closing."
  - speakerName: OLSON
    dialogue: "Hmph. It doesn\u2019t change what happened. He still failed"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Lin taking care of himself is hardly a failure. You want to talk failure?
      You couldn\u2019t handle running the shop with both of you there on a regular
      work schedule. Sounds to me like you're the bigger wuss around here. "
  - speakerName: OLSON
    dialogue: "How dare you?! It wasn\u2019t turning out enough profit and that was
      all. I\u2019m much better off as I am now."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Oh, is that why you\u2019re calling? You\u2019re better off? Is it
      not because you need him to save your failing business?"
  - speakerName: OLSON
    dialogue: "Why you\u2026"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: Hit a nerve, did I? This old lady has more than enough time to keep
      track of these things, Olson.
  - speakerName: OLSON
    dialogue: This conversation is over.
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: Of course it is, I never want you to contact anyone in this town ever
      again.
