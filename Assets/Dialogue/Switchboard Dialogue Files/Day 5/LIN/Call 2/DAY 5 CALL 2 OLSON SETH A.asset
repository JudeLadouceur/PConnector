    dialogue: "Seth\u2019s Repair Garage. What needs fixing?"
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: Hmph. I see how it is. Fine. Let him live with his own failure and
      get nothing out of it.
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Um, excuse me? Oh, hold on, let me take a wild guess. Lin\u2019s dad?"
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "Why yes, I am Lin\u2019s father. You\u2019ve heard of me, I take it?"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: 'You bet I have. Lin and I just got done talking about how much more
      successful his pizza shop has been without you around. '
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "Oh really? Well from what I\u2019ve heard, things have gone down hill
      for him quite quickly."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "What? The fact he had to close today? Turns out people like his pizza
      shop so much everyone\u2019s been pitching in to make him feel better. The
      guy\u2019s been a huge part of the town recently. But you would know all about
      that, right? Being his father and all, I\u2019m sure you keep track of that
      stuff."
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "Don\u2019t toy with me. You\u2019re the brother of Lucin, right? That
      so-called great inventor? I\u2019m sure that does wonders for your self confidence.
      You don\u2019t want to know what I can do to you."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "I don\u2019t need to be confident to tell a jerk to back off. You
      don\u2019t scare me."
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: I called to talk to Lin, not waste my time with you.
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Well forget it. Lin\u2019s my pal, and I\u2019m not gonna stand for
      this if you\u2019re so insistent on nagging him. Get lost."
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: Fine. I have no need to entertain this circus of a town any longer.
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Good. I don\u2019t want to hear of you talking to anyone in this town
      ever again."
