    dialogue: "Hey, this is Lin\u2019s pizza. Sorry, but we\u2019re closed today."
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "So I\u2019ve heard."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Wha\u2013DAD?! Is that you?!"
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "Indeed it is, Lin. So I\u2019ve received word that you\u2019ve actually
      closed for today. On a Friday of all days. Don\u2019t you know Friday\u2019s
      are best for business?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Oh, you don\u2019t get to lecture me on how to run this business!
      You walked away!"
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "And you declared you could run it better without me. I\u2019ve been
      watching from afar. So much for \u2018open seven days a week\u2019, huh?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Oh please. I\u2019m allowed to take breaks every once in a while.
      I\u2019ve learned that thanks to a close friend. Why did you call, anyways?
      Just to rub it in?"
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "I\u2019ve called to give you some advice. Leave the shop, come to
      me in the city. We\u2019ll start anew here."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: And why would I do that?!
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "What else do you have going for you? What happens when the shop goes
      out of business? I\u2019m offering you a chance at a better life now that you\u2019ve
      failed there."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "It\u2019s not a failure, dad. I\u2019ve got people here who support
      and care about me. Unlike you. I might be real tired right now, but I\u2019ll
      be back open soon enough. This won\u2019t be the end of my shop, I\u2019ll
      make sure of it. "
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "Unless you seriously think this failure won\u2019t affect your shop
      at all?"
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "Unless you seriously think this failure won\u2019t affect your shop
      at all?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Maybe, maybe not. But I sure don\u2019t need to be lectured on it
      by someone like you. I\u2019m not coming back to you, and I never will."
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: "This won\u2019t be the end of it, Lin. How much longer until this
      happens again? You need me! You hear me?! I\u2019m your father! Your flesh
      and blood! Your shop will fail, and you will lose everything if you don\u2019t
      take this chance. I\u2019m trying to save you from this!"
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Last I checked, you weren\u2019t a fortune teller, dad. You might
      be my father, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to call you my family. My family\u2019s
      here. With the people who actually care about me. My answer is no, and that\u2019s
      final."
  - speakerName: OLSON
    NewSpeakerName: 7
    dialogue: You will regret this.
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "No, I don\u2019t think I will."
