  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: Hello? This is Mrs. Perkins. Who is this?
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "Um\u2026 hi Mrs. Perkins. This is Lin. I\u2026 need some help."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Oh? What is it you need, Lin? I say, you don\u2019t sound too good."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "I\u2019m not doing too good I\u2019m afraid, Mrs. P. I feel awful.
      I don\u2019t have the energy to do anything. I\u2026 I barely had the effort
      to use the phone. I might have to close shop for the day, I just can\u2019t
      do it. GAH! I hate having to close shop like this, I never do. I never should."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Oh, Lin, dear. You can\u2019t be talking to yourself like that. It\u2019s
      alright if you\u2019re feeling burnt out, you should take a break."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "No, I shouldn\u2019t take a break. Sorry, Mrs. P, but that\u2019s
      one of the main things I advertise about my shop. We\u2019re always open, seven
      days a week. I\u2019m supposed to be the guy so passionate about pizza that
      I never close for a day, but\u2026 here I am."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Now you listen to me, young man. There is nobody telling you that
      this is who you need to be. It\u2019s a miracle you\u2019ve managed to push
      yourself like this for so long, anyhow. Not a single other person in this town
      works as hard as you do, dear. You don\u2019t just need a break, you deserve
      one."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "But\u2026 the business, it\u2013... people want their pizza, I could
      lose customers for that, and if the pizza shop goes under\u2026 Ugh, it probably
      will now. Dad was right."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "I think you\u2019re worried over nothing, dear. Everyone in this town
      loves your pizza. Losing a few dollars on a few days won\u2019t drag you under.
      It\u2019s alright to take a day off sometimes if it means keeping yourself
      healthy."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "I\u2026 I guess\u2026 but, the shop\u2019s reputation is built around
      that. My father\u2013"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Your father was a grumpy old crook who only cared about the dollars.
      You care about the pizza. The community. It\u2019s not how often you\u2019re
      open that\u2019s defined your shop\u2019s reputation, dear. It\u2019s the heart
      you\u2019ve put into running it the best way you can. That\u2019s what\u2019s
      made the difference in this community. Take from this old lady who\u2019s watched
      this town grow for some time. Your pizza shop has inspired so many others to
      put as much love into their work as you do."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "Aw, gee, Mrs. P. I\u2026"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "You can take a day off, dear. You should start taking days off each
      week! Get some rest, recover! It\u2019ll do you good! "
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "You know what, Mrs. P? I think I\u2019ll give it a shot. Maybe I don\u2019t
      have to think about pizza all the time. Thanks. This talk helped a lot."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "I\u2019m glad to hear it dear. How about you meet me in the park for
      a nice chat for the day? Enjoy having a day of rest for once."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: That sounds great, Mrs. P. Thank you so much.
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "It\u2019s my pleasure, dear. See you there."
