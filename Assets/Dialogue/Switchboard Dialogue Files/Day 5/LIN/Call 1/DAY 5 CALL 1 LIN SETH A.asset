    dialogue: "Seth\u2019s Repair Garage. What needs fixing?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "I\u2026 I think I need fixing, Seth."
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: Lin? Buddy? Is that you? You alright?
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "Yeah it\u2019s me. But no, I\u2019m not alright, I\u2026 I need your
      help."
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Oh, uh\u2013alright, man. What\u2019s up? How can I help?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "I might not be able to open my shop today, I suddenly feel like I\u2019ve
      completely crashed, I\u2026 I barely had the energy to use the phone. I hate
      having to close shop like this, I never do. I never should. I\u2013"
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Hold on, I\u2019m gonna stop you right there, Lin."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: What?
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "You don\u2019t need to be open seven days a week. You\u2019ve already
      baffled the whole town on how you\u2019ve been doing it for so long. It\u2019s
      alright to close shop every once in a while. You just need a break, and that\u2019s
      normal. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "I\u2026 well\u2026"
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Don\u2019t you know that literally everybody else with a job in this
      town takes days off on weekends? I take weekends off, and I literally work
      out of my own garage. You should too! Don\u2019t worry about it, it will be
      fine. You need the break."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "But\u2026 it will cost me business\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t do that.
      I\u2019ve gotta be there to make the town pizza."
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: A few less pizzas sold never killed anyone, Lin. Take a break. You
      need it. Please. For me?
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "No, I\u2019m thinking of the long run. I\u2019m known as the pizza
      shop that\u2019s always open! The one-man army! The pizza shop could go under,
      it\u2019s probably going to now that I\u2019m like this, I\u2026 dad was right.
      I can\u2019t do this."
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: Hey, Lin.
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: Yeah?
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "You don\u2019t need to prove anything to your father. This isn\u2019t
      his pizza shop, last time I checked. Not anymore. It\u2019s yours."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "But\u2013"
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "You\u2019re overthinking this. People love your pizza shop and respect
      all the effort you put into it. Closing down for a couple days a week to keep
      yourself healthy isn\u2019t going to change that. You\u2019ve put more love
      and care into this shop than your father ever did. He was the one who walked
      away. You didn\u2019t give up. Taking some time to take care of yourself isn\u2019t
      giving up, either. It\u2019s just a break. That\u2019s all it is, and you\u2019re
      allowed to take on every once in a while."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "Seth, I\u2026 wow. That\u2026 means a lot. I had no idea you were
      one for giving pep talks to strangers."
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Ha! You ain\u2019t a stranger, pal. You\u2019re my friend. I\u2019m
      here to look out for ya. Now how about this? You meet me in the park, and I\u2019ll
      make us a pizza this time. It might not be up to your standards, but it\u2019ll
      be enough for you and I do have a nice chat on your day off."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "I\u2026 that sounds great, Seth. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll be there."
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "That\u2019s what friends are for, Lin. See you there."
