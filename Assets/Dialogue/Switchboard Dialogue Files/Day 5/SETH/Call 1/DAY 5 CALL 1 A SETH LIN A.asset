    dialogue: "Lin\u2019s pizza It\u2019s like a dream in your mouth! What do you
      need?"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "I\u2026 ugh, sorry Lin. Wrong line."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: Seth? You okay? You sound upset.
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Yeah, you could say that. Guess I should tell you while I\u2019m here.
      I\u2019m closing shop. I won\u2019t be repairing things anymore."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: What?! Why? Are you alright?
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "No, I\u2019m not. I keep trying to be there for people, to fix things
      and help them out. But I keep screwing up. I messed up again, destroyed my
      own delivery guy\u2019s car. So I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m done with this stuff."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "But I thought you loved repairing things! Besides, everybody messes
      up every once in a while. It\u2019s fine!"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "It\u2019s not fine, Lin. Yeah, I want to fix things, but I\u2019m
      just not good at it. I mean, look at my brother. He\u2019s out there making
      a difference in the world wherever he goes and I\u2019m just\u2026 here. Messing
      up over and over."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Seth, buddy. I mess up way more than you do. I know you want to be
      one of the most reliable people in the town, and you are! You fix tons of stuff
      for us all the time! Sure, maybe sometimes you mess up, and the bad stuff often
      stands out from the good stuff, but there is so much more good that you\u2019ve
      done! You\u2019re not giving yourself enough credit."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: Really? Like what?
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Um, like my pizza shop? Do you have any idea how many times you\u2019ve
      fixed things here for me? My fridge, oven, even my electrical grid! Not just
      once, either. You\u2019ve fixed my stuff time and time again. I would have
      closed shop way long ago if you hadn\u2019t been helping me."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Well\u2026 I guess so, but the fact that those things broke again
      means I didn\u2019t do good enough. Some of the stuff I build still falls apart\u2026"
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Nothing built can last forever, Seth. Tons of stuff can happen. Remember
      how I said I make mistakes? Yeah. I make tons. The reason you keep fixing my
      stuff is because I keep breaking it. I don\u2019t always think things through
      and keep messing up your repairs. Even then, you haven\u2019t had to touch
      my electrical panel in months! Whatever you did to the thing really worked!
      There\u2019s always a lot more to how repairs last than the fixing job, you
      know. It\u2019s how people use what you fix that changes it, not how you might
      have messed up"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "I guess\u2026 I never thought of it that way."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "You\u2019ve made a huge difference in this town Seth. It doesn\u2019t
      matter what your brother might be out and doing. Maybe he\u2019s doing bigger
      stuff, but you\u2019ve made a real difference to everyone here. You\u2019re
      not a bad repair guy. It\u2019s okay to mess up every once in a while. You
      matter to this town."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Wow, Lin\u2026 thanks. I hadn\u2019t considered that.  That means
      a lot to me."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Of course, Seth. Don\u2019t you worry about it! I\u2019m just glad
      I could help"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Thanks again Lin. I think I\u2019ll stop by for an extra large later.
      I could use some good pizza right about now."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Of course! I\u2019ll have it ready before you even arrive!"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: See ya later, Lin.
