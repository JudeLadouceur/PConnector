  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: Hello! Mrs. Perkins speaking.
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "I\u2026 ugh, sorry Mrs. Perkins. Wrong line."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh, Seth? I must say, you don\u2019t sound like you're doing too good.
      Is everything alright?"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Yeah, you could say that. Guess I should tell you while I\u2019m here.
      I\u2019m closing shop. I won\u2019t be repairing things anymore"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh, no! That\u2019s terrible, dear. What made you come to this decision?"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "I\u2026 I keep trying to be there for people, to fix things and help
      them out. But I keep screwing up. I messed up again, destroyed my own delivery
      guy\u2019s car. So I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m done with this stuff."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Everyone will mess up at some point, dear! You shouldn\u2019t worry
      so much about it. Besides, isn\u2019t this your passion? You shouldn\u2019t
      give that up!"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "What choice do I have? Yeah, I want to fix things, but I\u2019m just
      not good at it. I mean, look at my brother. He\u2019s out there making a difference
      in the world wherever he goes and I\u2019m just\u2026 here. Messing up over
      and over."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh, don\u2019t talk to yourself like that. You don\u2019t mess up
      nearly as often as you think. You\u2019ve done plenty of helpful things! You
      fixed my walker, remember? I could have been seriously hurt otherwise."
  - speakerName: PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "That\u2019s one of the hard things about being as good as you are,
      there are so many good things that you do, and the bad things are so rare that
      when they happen, they stand out from the rest. But that doesn\u2019t take
      away from all the good you\u2019ve done"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "All the good I\u2019ve done? Like what? Aside from your walker, I
      guess. "
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Dear, I\u2019ve lived in this town for a long time, and I can tell
      you that you have done plenty over the years. Anything from fixing small things
      for my neighbor to repairing the lighting system in the town hall! I\u2019ve
      seen you repair things so well even Howard was flabbergasted, and I\u2019ll
      tell you, my husband was rarely speechless."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "R-really? Howard? I\u2026 I guess\u2026"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "You\u2019re allowed to say it, dear. You have done a lot for this
      town. It doesn\u2019t matter what your brother is off doing. You\u2019re you,
      and are making your own kind of difference. "
  - speakerName: PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "This town has been kept together by your repairs. Just because it
      hasn\u2019t resulted in some world-altering achievement, doesn\u2019t mean
      that it doesn\u2019t matter to each and every person you\u2019ve helped here."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "I guess\u2026 I never thought of it that way. Wow, thanks, Mrs. P.
      I never looked at it that way."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Of course, dear. Sometimes you just need a change in perspective.
      I may be old, but that just means I\u2019ve been around longer to see all the
      great things you\u2019ve done for this town. Don\u2019t discredit yourself!"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: Aw, gee Mrs. Perkins. That means a lot coming from you. Thanks again.
      Really. This means a lot to me.
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Of course! I\u2019m always happy to have a chat if you need someone
      to talk to."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "You know what, Mrs. Perkins? I think I\u2019ll take you up on that
      offer. Would you want to sit down and talk later today?"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "That would be lovely, dear! I\u2019m going to be here all day, so
      you just stop by whenever you\u2019re feeling like it."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: Sounds good. Thanks again, Mrs. Perkins!
