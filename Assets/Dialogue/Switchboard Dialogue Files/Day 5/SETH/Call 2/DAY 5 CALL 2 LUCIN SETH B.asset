    dialogue: Wha- Lucin?! Why are you of all people calling me?
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    dialogue: "What do you mean \u2018me of all people\u2019? You\u2019re my brother!

      much more capable than you\u2019ve given yourself credit for."
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Sorry, dude. But I\u2019m not. You just focus on your fancy city stuff.
