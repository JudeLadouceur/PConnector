    dialogue: "Lin\u2019s pizza! Fresher than you would believe! What can I get for
      you?"
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "What? I\u2019m sorry, I was hoping to talk to Seth."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Seth? Oh I just talked to him earlier! What\u2019s up? You need him
      for some repairs or something?"
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "Not quite. I\u2019m his brother, actually. I heard he might be closing
      down and was worried, so I wanted to talk to him."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Really?! Lucin? The Lucin? How about that! Well, you don\u2019t need
      to worry. He was upset, yeah, but he really was just not giving himself enough
      credit for what he does. We had a talk, and he\u2019s doing much better now."
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "Oh, that\u2019s good to hear! It seems like I\u2019m not needed."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Well I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be happy to know you called! He probably
      gets worried you don\u2019t have time for him with everything you do."
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "Yeah, I worry he thinks that too\u2026 But of course I have time for
      him! He\u2019s my brother. Even I owe him more than he probably realizes."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Well, I\u2019m actually seeing him for pizza later. I\u2019m sure
      he\u2019d love to call you back if he knew you were looking to talk to him."
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: Thanks! That would be nice. Thanks for helping him out.
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "No problem. He\u2019s not closing shop, so don\u2019t worry about
      it."
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: Alright. Thanks for your time, Lin. Have a good day!
