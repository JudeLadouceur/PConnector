    dialogue: "Seth\u2019s Repair Garage. What needs fixing?"
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "Glad to know the title\u2019s still the same."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: Wha- Lucin?! That you?
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "Of course it\u2019s me. How you doing, dude? I heard you might be
      closing shop, and I was worried. You love that town, man. You shouldn\u2019t
      give up like that!"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Oh, yeah. I was having a pretty bad day. But I talked to a close friend
      about it, and I\u2019m doing much better now, so you don\u2019t have to worry
      about me."
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "Oh, that\u2019s great to hear. I guess I\u2019m not needed then. I\u2026
      I can leave you be."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Leave me be? It\u2019s been way too long since I\u2019ve heard from
      you! You should stay and chat for a bit! I\u2019m more worried about taking
      up your time, seeing how busy you usually are\u2026"
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "Well, I wasn't sure how much you wanted to talk to me, after I moved
      to the big city and all\u2026"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "You were just following your dream, dude. You got an offer, and I\u2019m
      glad you took it. Though\u2026 it really means a lot to know you haven\u2019t
      just forgotten about me up there."
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "I could never forget you, man. I wouldn\u2019t have gotten that offer
      in the first place if you didn\u2019t help me have the guts to send that letter.
      And don\u2019t worry about taking up my time. Sure I\u2019ve got meetings and
      whatnot, but they\u2019re way too boring. I\u2019ll take any excuse to miss
      a few if I can."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: Ha! Well, if you really need some time away, why not come down for
      a visit? It would be nice to chat with you face to face, you know.
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "Yeah, I'd like that! I\u2019ll find some time and come down for a
      day or two."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "But if you can\u2019t find time?"
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: "Then I\u2019ll make time. I\u2019m not gonna let some fancy knowitall
      in a business suit tell me that I can\u2019t talk to my brother."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Sounds like a plan, then. You just let me know when you\u2019re on
      your way."
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    NewSpeakerName: 8
    dialogue: Will do! See you soon!
