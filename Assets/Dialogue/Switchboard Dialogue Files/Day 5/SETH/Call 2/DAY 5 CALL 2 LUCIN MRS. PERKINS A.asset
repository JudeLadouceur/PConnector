  lines:
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: Hello! This is Mrs. Perkins.
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    dialogue: "What? I\u2019m sorry, I was hoping to talk to Seth."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Seth? Hold on, I recognize your voice\u2026 your Seth\u2019s brother,
      aren\u2019t you? Lucin?"
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    dialogue: Perceptive as always, Mrs. Perkins.
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Oh, it\u2019s good to hear from you, Lucin! How\u2019s life in the
      big city for a famous fellow like you?"
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    dialogue: Well, as busy as you would expect. Too many business meetings for my
      taste. Now, sorry, but I was hoping to talk to Seth. I heard he might be closing
      shop, and was hoping to check up on him.
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Oh, you\u2019re still caring as always, Lucin. But you don\u2019t
      need to worry about him. I just talked to him earlier, and he\u2019s feeling
      much better now. He won\u2019t be closing down shop. "
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    dialogue: "Really? That\u2019s great to hear, Mrs. Perkins. Thank you so much."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "But of course! Seth has done so much for this community, and hasn\u2019t
      given himself nearly enough credit. He just needed some help realizing it."
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    dialogue: "Well I\u2019m really grateful for your help, Mrs. Perkins. I guess
      I won\u2019t be needed, then."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Well I\u2019m sure Seth would still be happy to know you called! I\u2019m
      actually going to have a chat with him later today, I can let him know you
      called, and I\u2019m sure he will call you back when he has the time."
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    dialogue: That would be nice, Mrs. Perkins. Thank you!
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Of course, dear. It was really nice of you to call. I know he\u2019ll
      appreciate it."
  - speakerName: LUCIN
    dialogue: Thanks again, Mrs. Perkins. Have a good day!
