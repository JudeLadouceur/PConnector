    dialogue: Hello? This is Mrs. Perkins. Who is this?
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Uh, hey Ms. Perkins. Uh, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have some spare
      parts? Bolts, washers, metal pipes, the like? Uh, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m
      all out."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh, well yes, I do in fact! Why don\u2019t you come by, I have some
      of the like in the storage room, I think. Things that are left over from the
      gizmos Howard used to collect. What led to this pickle though? I\u2019ve never
      known you to need parts before."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: I, uh, forgot to make an order. I, uh, I just got so busy, I just had...
      I feel just awful even asking. You are supposed to rely on me, and I failed.

    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Ah, so that\u2019s all. I thought it\u2019d be something much worse,
      dearie. Happens to the best of us. Back in the day, I left the door unlocked
      a couple times and when my husband got home, I got such an earful over it.
      We\u2019re friends, dear. I knew you since you were just born. You can rely
      on me too. "
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Ah, I guess\u2026still feels wrong though."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: I know, dear, but trying to stand alone will just make you crumble.
      But until you understand, this can stay our little secret, okay?
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Yeah, okay. Our little secret. I\u2019ll be right over for the parts.
      Thanks, Mrs. P."
