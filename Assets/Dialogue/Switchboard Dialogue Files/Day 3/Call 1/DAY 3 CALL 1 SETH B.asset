    dialogue: "Seth\u2019s Repair Garage. What do you need fixed?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: Oh, Seth? This is Lin! Pizza guy. I was hoping you could help me out.
      I really need a favor right about now.
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Lin? Uh-sure. What\u2019s the problem?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: Well I was putting out a ton of pizzas to be delivered today, at record
      time for me honestly, but I checked the label and found out that something
      screwed up with my delivery, it expired before it even got here!
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Yeesh, that\u2019s rough. But I didn\u2019t order a pizza today, so
      you don\u2019t have to worry about me."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Yeah, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re okay, but I still need to let
      the rest of the town know! Do you know of anything I could do to let people
      know before those deliveries arrive?"
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Sorry, Lin. I\u2019m just the local repair guy. Not like I really
      know anyone here that well. I can let people who come to my shop know, but
      I still got a business to run, I can\u2019t just risk my business like that,
      you know?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Yeah, I get it. Sorry man, I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll think of something
      else. You have a good day."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: You too, Lin. Good luck.
