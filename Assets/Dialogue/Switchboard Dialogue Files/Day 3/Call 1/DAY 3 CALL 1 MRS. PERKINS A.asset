    dialogue: Hello? This is Mrs. Perkins. May I ask who this is?
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: Oh, hey Mrs. Perkins. This is Lin! Pizza guy. I was hoping you could
      help me out. I really need a favor right about now.
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: Oh? What is it you need, dear?
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: Well I was putting out a ton of pizzas to be delivered today, moving
      at record speed might I add, uh-but I checked the label and found out that
      something screwed up with my delivery, it expired before it even got here!
      I need to get the word out before those deliveries arrive, but I have no idea
      how!
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh dear, that sounds like quite the pickle. Though I don\u2019t think
      I\u2019ll be much help here. I would go out and let some folks know, but my
      hips ain\u2019t what they used to be, and the roads are so worn these days.
      I won\u2019t get anywhere fast."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Yeah, that makes sense. Sorry for bothering you Mrs. Perkins. I think
      this is a lost cause, I just\u2026 don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t
      be messing up like this\u2026"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Well you don\u2019t need to deal with it alone, dear. How about you
      come by my place and we can have a nice chat. You don\u2019t have to deal with
      this alone, you know."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "That\u2019s not gonna change anything, but\u2026 If I can\u2019t do
      anything about it, why not? Sure Mrs. Perkins, I\u2019ll stop by. I think I
      could really use a listening ear right about now. Maybe even some advice. I
      really hope I don\u2019t have to give this job up."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "That\u2019s great to hear, dear. I\u2019m always here to help if you
      ever need me."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Thanks, Mrs. Perkins. I\u2019ll be right over as soon as I close up."
