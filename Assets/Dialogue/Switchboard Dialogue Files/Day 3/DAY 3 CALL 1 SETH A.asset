    dialogue: "Seth\u2019s Repair Garage! How can I help?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "Oh, Seth? Hey, it\u2019s Lin! Pizza guy. I was hoping you could help
      me out. I really need a favor right about now."
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Lin? Uh-sure. What\u2019s up?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: Well I was putting out a ton of pizzas to be delivered today, a record
      time for me, honestly, but I checked the label and found out that something
      screwed up with my delivery, it expired before it even got here!
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Oh man, that\u2019s rough. But\u2026 What can I do about it? Not like
      I\u2019m much help with anything but repairs."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "I dunno\u2026 maybe help me spread the word? I just really need to
      let people know before those pizzas arrive."
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Oh, I think I have just the thing! I\u2019ll just send out an email
      to all my customers like I would for my usual shop updates. People seem to
      email me fairly often, will probably get the word out."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: Wow, thanks so much Seth, that means a ton! Sorry for throwing this
      at you so suddenly.
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Hey, it\u2019s no problem man. Honestly, it\u2019s a bit of a relief,
      I screwed up recently too, and knowing it\u2019s not just me\u2026we all lean
      on each other sometimes, huh."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: Really? How about that! Would you want to grab a pizza and have a chat
      later today or something? A pizza without expired tomato sauce.
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Sounds like fun. Drop by my place after you finish work, I\u2019ll
      be here."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: Alright, I will! Thanks again Seth!
