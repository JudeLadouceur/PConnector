    dialogue: "Hey there! Bob here again. You know, I\u2019ve heard a lot of good
      things about you this past week. It\u2019s strange, I don\u2019t call people
      much, but can still tell you mean a lot to this community. I see it in everyone
      else. You\u2019re that link between them, you know? "

    dialogue: You keep being you, alright? Just doing that has already made a big
      impact here, and that makes me real happy, I tell you.
