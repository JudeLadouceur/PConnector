    dialogue: Hello? This is Mrs. Perkins. Who is this?
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Hey, Mrs. Perkins. You, uh, wouldn\u2019t happen to have some spare
      parts? Bolts, washers, metal pipes, the like?"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh, well yes, I do in fact! Why don\u2019t you come by, I have some
      of the like in the storage room I think. Things that are left over from the
      gizmos Howard used to collect. What led to this pickle though? I\u2019ve never
      known you to need parts before."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "I, uh, forgot to make an order. Just like me to be this useless, but
      I\u2019m hoping to not let anyone down regardless."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Ah, so that\u2019s all. I thought it\u2019d be something much worse,
      dearie. Happens to the best of us, back in the day I left the door unlocked
      a couple times and when my husband got home I got such an earful over it. Besides,
      you do a wonderful job of repairing things, nobody would mind having to wait
      a bit. Remind yourself of that sometimes, dearie."
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Ah, I guess\u2026still feel awful though."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: I know, dear, but trying to stand alone will just make you crumble.
      But if it helps, this is our little secret, okay? Come on over, we can chat
      while we look.
  - speakerName: SETH
    NewSpeakerName: 3
    dialogue: "Yeah, okay. Our little secret. I\u2019ll be right over for the parts.
      Thanks, Mrs. Perkins."
