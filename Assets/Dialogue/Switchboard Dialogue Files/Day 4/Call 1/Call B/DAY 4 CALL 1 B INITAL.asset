    dialogue: "Oh hello, dear. This is Mrs. Perkins. You see, these past few days
      have been a lot on me. I feel I\u2019ve really been losing my connection to
      this town in my age. Oh, it gets so hard to keep up when the world moves too
      fast\u2026 I hate to say it dear, but I think I need to move on. I\u2019ve
      lost touch with this town, and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m moving. It\u2019s
      too hard to get anywhere, and I feel so forgotten all the time. Don\u2019t
      try and convince me otherwise, I\u2019ve already made the arrangements. All
      I have left to do is contact the emergency line so I can cancel any upcoming
      appointments of mine. Could you do this old lady that one last favor?"
