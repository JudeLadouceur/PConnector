  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Hello, dear. This is Mrs. Perkins. I apologize, as this isn\u2019t
      much of an emergency, but I need to cancel some appointments I have with the
      health centre."
  - speakerName: RECEPTIONIST

      do you need cancelled? Can I reschedule them for you?

      go."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    dialogue: "Thank you so much, dear. You\u2019ve been a great help. Though I must
      be going now, I have much to do to get ready. "
