    dialogue: "Lin\u2019s Pizza! What kind of fresh do you want today?"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh, hello Lin. This is Mrs. Perkins. I\u2019m sorry, but it seems
      I\u2019ve been connected to the wrong line."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Oh? You don\u2019t sound great, Mrs. Perkins. Are you alright? Maybe
      a pizza will help."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "I suppose this is a bit bittersweet for me, dear. You see, I\u2019ve
      made plans to move out of town. I can\u2019t connect with the people here anymore,
      and am looking to start anew."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Oh\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019m terribly sorry to hear that Mrs. Perkins.
      And now you can\u2019t even get connected to the right line? Gosh, I wish I
      had talked to you more\u2026"
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh, don\u2019t worry about it dear. I think it\u2019s me more than
      it is you. Though I\u2019ll tell you, your pizza has been some of the finest
      pizza I\u2019ve ever had. If I\u2019m going to miss anything from this town,
      it will be the taste of that glorious cooking of yours."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "Aw, Mrs. Perkins\u2026 That means a lot coming from you, I\u2026 I
      don\u2019t know what to say. How about this? I\u2019ll send you a pizza to
      go, the biggest and best I have, free of charge."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "Oh, you don\u2019t have to do that, dear."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: "But I will, Mrs. Perkins! You can always order from afar! I\u2019m
      getting you that pizza, and I hope it will be something you can remember me
      by."
  - speakerName: MRS. PERKINS
    NewSpeakerName: 1
    dialogue: "You\u2019re such a kind soul, dear. I\u2019ll look forward to it.
      Though I must go now. I will have to walk to the health centre to cancel my
      appointments. You take care of yourself, dear."
  - speakerName: LIN
    NewSpeakerName: 2
    dialogue: And you, Mrs. Perkins. Good luck, I hope things work out for you.
