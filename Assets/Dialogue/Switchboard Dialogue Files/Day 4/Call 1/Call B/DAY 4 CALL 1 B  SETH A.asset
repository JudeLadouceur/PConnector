    dialogue: "Oh, did you try to connect me to Seth, dear? Didn\u2019t you hear?
      He\u2019s out of town today. This kind of thing is why I need to go, nobody
      listens to me or understands me\u2026 my mind is made up. Thank you for all
      the help and care you\u2019ve given the town, even if you\u2019ve only been
      here briefly. I\u2019m sure it means a lot to them, but I really must be going.
      I\u2019ll be sure to leave Seth a note before I leave, though. Now I guess
      I\u2019ll have to walk to the health centre to cancel those appointments\u2026
      You have a good day, dear."
