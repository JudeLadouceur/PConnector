Currently, you are able to:
- StartDialogue -> start dialogue by providing a script (in the form of a scriptableObject. To create one, check the bottom of the document),
- NextLine -> go to the next line of dialogue,
- SetDialogueLine -> if for whatever reason you need to play a line that is not the very next one, use this and provide the line number,
- EndDialogue -> stop the dialogue and close the box.

In order to create a dialogue asset (please do this in the dialogue folder), right click in assets, go to Create / ScriptableObjects(at the top) / Dialogue Asset.
