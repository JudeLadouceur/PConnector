    dialogue: "This is Seth\u2019s Repair Garage. What can I do for ya?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "Oh\u2013uh, hey Seth! This is Lin from the pizza place. I was hoping
      you could do me a favor."
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Sure, what\u2019s up? Need the dishwasher fixed again? Because I swear
      that thing\u2019s just old, fixing can only do so much at this point."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "No, not this time Seth. You see, a big group cancelled right when
      I made their order, and I have some pizza just hanging around. I want to sell
      it while it\u2019s fresh, but\u2026"
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "You can\u2019t just give it away for free?"
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "Yeah\u2026 b-but I could sell it to you for a discount! Thirty percent
      off"
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Don\u2019t worry Lin, I'll throw you a bone here. It\u2019s actually
      rather convenient because I forgot my lunch today, anyways."
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: Oh, wow. Thanks a lot, Seth.
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: No worries, dude. You know, you should try hanging out with some of
      the townsfolk sometime. It would make it a lot easier for you to call in favors
      like this.
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "I guess\u2026 I\u2019ve just got a lot to do here, and\u2013"
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: "Then give yourself a break! I swear dude, I never see you let that
      place close for even a day\u2026"
  - speakerName: LIN
    dialogue: "I\u2019ll think about it. Still, I should deliver this while it\u2019s
      hot! Thanks again for this, I\u2019ll be over soon!"
  - speakerName: SETH
    dialogue: See you soon, Lin.
