In order to create a character asset (please do this in the character folder), right click in assets, go to Create / ScriptableObjects(at the top) / Character.

From there, you can assign them a name and variables. Currently, you can give them bools and ints.

There are two places to put characters so far:

-You can assign notches on the switchboard to a character. In the switchboard scene -> Switchboard. in the notch creator script, open the notches array and open a notch area and assign a character there. 

-You can put characters into the call manager. In the Switchboard scene -> Switchboard -> callManager. Select the day that this dialogue can happen in, which call it can happen in, then open 
connections and put it with the character you call for the dialogue
